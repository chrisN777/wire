# Testing wire

This `test/` subfolder is the basis for testing wire. It contains both sample models and environments to instantiate these models.

Currently supported:

 * `test/ubuntu`: Vagrantfile to install 14.04 and wire (from rubygems.org, latest)
 * `test/ubuntuwork`: Vagrantfile to install 14.04, mapping wire into the vm to test locally
