== dewiring testing vm

Welcome to the Ubuntu 14.04 testing vm of de-wiring.

=== automated test case
To run the full test case, you'll need a clean system meaning there
may be no bridges, containers etc. be present, otherwise rspec tests
will be confused.

 $ cd testcase.d
 $ rake spec

=== Manual testing

~/test/d1 contains a small testcase, which is used by the automated
test case above. 

 $ wire --help
 $ cd /home/vagrant/test/models/simple-1z1n1ag
 
Validate the model for logical correctness (i.e. no typos, ip ranges match etc.)
 
 $ wire validate

Verify that model is alive (should fail)

 $ wire verify

Bring model up

 $ wire up

Verify again, play around with docker ps, /sbin/ip, ovs-vsctl show.
Have a serverspec generated and executed:

 $ wire spec --run

Take it down, verify, spec, see a clean system

 $ wire down

For more output, give --debug.
